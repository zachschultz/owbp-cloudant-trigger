#   Package:    cloudant-trigger
#   Action:     cloudant-trigger/process-change.js
#   Sequence:   cloudant-trigger/process-change-cloudant-sequence
#   Trigger:    data-inserted-trigger
#   Rule:       log-change-rule

# This manifest file reads following env. variables:
#   CLOUDANT_HOSTNAME
#   CLOUDANT_USERNAME
